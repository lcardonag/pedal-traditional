## Running the app
Ensure you the data requirements settled, then use the `mvnw` bin or IntelliJ runner to start the application.

### Database

The bike_commerce application uses two databases;
The SQL Server database should have the following table;

*  `employees` table for storing employees data
The postgresql database should have the following tables;
* bikes
* service_user
* bike_order

  

### Data Requirements
This application uses PostgresQL and SQL Server databases with their datasources configured in the `com.example.bike_commerce.configuration` package. To connect with the databases, the `application.properties` file should have the following properties;

Ensure to replace the placeholders in the angle brackets

```yml

# POSTGRES DATABASE

spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.jdbc.lob.non_contextual_creation=true

spring.datasource.customers.url=<POSTGRES_DB_URL>

spring.datasource.customers.username=<POSTGRES_DB_USERNAME>

spring.datasource.customers.password=<POSTGRES_DB_PASSWORD>
  

# SQL SERVER DATABASE

spring.datasource.employees.url=<SQL_SERVER_URL>

spring.datasource.employees.username=<SQL_SERVER_USERNAME>

spring.datasource.employees.password=<SQL_SERVER_PASSWORD>

spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.SQLServerDialect

```

The `./ebike_data.sql` file contains SQL statements to create the columns within the aforementioned tables.
